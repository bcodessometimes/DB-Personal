            Mission Statement
        </div>
        <div className="missionBody">
            This is where we will put all the other stuff about the mission statement
            I havent decided yet what we are putting here but it dosent really matter 
            at this very moment as long as there is something on the page and its
            displaying I will be happy. Is this all printing on the same line? I dont know. 
            I guess I will find out in a moment when I switch back over to see how this looks.
            In hind sight I should have just used lorem. 
        </div>
    </div>

export default MissionStatement;
