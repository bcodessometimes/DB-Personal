        <p>I believe the only way to put a disreputable breeder, puppy mill, or fake rescue out of business is to make available to the marketplace a far superior product. To raise the education and standards of the consuming public to include source information and soundness of the animal is paramount. I have chosen to become a breeder of the dogs that people want to have as part of their families. Responsible health tested, individually raised, trained, socialized, and nurtured family members.</p>
