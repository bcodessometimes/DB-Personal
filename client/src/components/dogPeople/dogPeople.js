        <p>We have placed puppies into various families throughout the United States, and have received feedback from these families and they are thrilled with their puppies. You really can not underestimate the value of a great start. They came with amazing love and daily training and socialization in our home. They are a healthy quality product and family member that I am so very proud to have participated in the process of. These beloved genetically sound puppies being available make it that much harder for a puppy mill to thrive. Let's put all the mills out of business!</p>
